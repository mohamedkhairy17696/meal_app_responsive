# meal_app
In this project, I Used JSON to create data and State management "Provider" to build the logic of the app. This app consists of many screens and related screens and moves between related screens with navigation and I used filters logic between categories screen, meals Screen, and description screen of the meal. In this app, there is a beautiful theme and saved it by shared preferences. In this app, there is a drawer widget consists of some screens. This app supports Arabic and English. It is a responsive app in portrait and landscape.
